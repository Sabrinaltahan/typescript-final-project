## Project Overview

The project aims to apply knowledge gained from previous parts of the course into a larger, cohesive project, utilizing TypeScript programming and Angular as the framework. The task involves creating a website for a fictional university or college, allowing users to browse available courses and create their own course frameworks.

### Purpose

The main purpose of the project is to:

- Develop a website using Angular and TypeScript.
- Retrieve and process external data to present on the website.
- Demonstrate integration of various course components into a comprehensive website.
- Produce a project report detailing the solution.

### Task

The primary task is to create a website where users can search for courses and build their course schedules. Angular is chosen as the framework, and TypeScript as the programming language. The website's source code must be version-controlled with Git and deployed to a web host.

### JSON Data

The project utilizes a JSON file (`miun_courses.json`) containing course data, with fields including course code, subject, points, and syllabus link.

### Basic Requirements

The application must adhere to the following basic requirements:

- Built with Angular and TypeScript.
- Contains at least two subpages: one for course search and display, and another for course framework.
- Utilizes components and routing.
- Implements at least two services: one for course data and another for framework management.
- Stores the created framework schedule using localStorage.
- Source code is version-controlled with Git.
- Deployed to a publicly available web host.

### Course Requirements

The course section of the website must meet the following requirements:

- Display courses with sorting options by course code, name, points, and subject.
- Enable filtering by course code and name, and selection by subject.
- Allow users to add courses to their timetable.
- Show the number of courses in the current search and selected selection.

### Framework Schedule Requirements

The framework schedule section of the website must meet the following requirements:

- Display selected courses for the framework schedule.
- Calculate the total higher education credits for the selected courses.
- Allow users to remove courses from the framework schedule.
- Persist changes in the framework schedule using localStorage or a custom web service.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally and deploy it to a web host, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Build the Angular application.
4. Deploy the built application to a web host.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, learners will gain practical experience in building a comprehensive website using Angular and TypeScript, integrating external data, and implementing essential features such as search, filtering, and scheduling.
